# Style Guide

## General Guidelines

## Git

[Use good git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Please
squash/rebase liberally.

## C formatting

Way Cooler formats its C code using clang-format. This format is mostly the same
format as wlroots, though there are some differences. Whatever clang-format
corrects to is the correct style.

Imports are grouped as described by the Google import style guide.
