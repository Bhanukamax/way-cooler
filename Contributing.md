# Contributing to Way Cooler

To contribute code, all that is required is that you have an email address and you can send a pull request via Github.

Regardless if you are planning for or looking for something to do, it's best if you reach out via the [IRC channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=awesome&uio=d4) first.

# Release Cycle
For pre-1.0 there is no fixed release. Once 1.0 has been released a release cycle will be determined and will probably follow what Awesome does.

# Coding style
Please run rustfmt on your code before submission. That is the easiest way to ensure you follow the code style. To invoke the formatter, simply run `cargo fmt`.
